# Minimal SQL Engine

## Overview
The Minimal SQL Engine is a lightweight educational project designed to demonstrate the fundamental architecture of a SQL engine. It provides a basic framework for parsing SQL statements, executing logical plans, and managing data storage. This project serves as a foundation for learning about SQL engine internals and can be extended with more complex features in the future.

## Future Work
This project is intended as a starting point for building a more comprehensive SQL engine. Future enhancements may include:

- Implementing more SQL features and syntax.
- Adding optimization techniques for query execution.
- Enhancing error handling and reporting mechanisms.
- Expanding the testing framework to cover more scenarios.
